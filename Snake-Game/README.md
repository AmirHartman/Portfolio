# 🐍 Snake Game – Python (OOP + GUI)

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the turtle graphics library.  
It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by organizing the game into modular classes: Snake, Food, and Scoreboard.

---

## 🎮 Game Features

- Real-time snake movement using arrow keys  
- Random food generation  
- Score tracking and Game Over detection  
- Clean separation of logic using Python classes  
- Simple and responsive interface via `turtle`

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Concepts

- **Python 3**
- **turtle module** (built-in)
- **OOP principles**:
  - Class inheritance  
  - State tracking  
  - Method encapsulation
- **Game loop logic** and screen refreshing
- Basic **collision detection**

## 🗂️ File Structure

```
Snake-Game/
├── main.py             # Main game loop and setup
├── snake.py            # Snake class: body, movement, collision
├── food.py             # Food class: placement and display
└── score.py            # Scoreboard class: score handling and game over
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed (no external libraries needed).

```bash
python main.py
```

**Controls**:  
Use the arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`) to move the snake.

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add difficulty levels   
- Add obstacles or walls  
- Implement pause functionality  
- Restrict the amount of tries in each run
