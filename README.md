# 📁 Amir Hartman – Portfolio

Welcome to my software development portfolio!  
This repository showcases a range of personal, academic, and self-learning projects that demonstrate my passion for Python, automation, system programming, and software design.

I’m currently a student seeking my first role in the tech industry – open to full-time, part-time, or student positions.  
My projects reflect hands-on learning, curiosity, and the ability to build complete systems from the ground up.
